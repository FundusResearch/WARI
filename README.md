The Wide-Angle Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction

Introduction: The Wide-field images database has been established to enable comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels of the wide-angle retinal images. On this page, instructions can be found on downloading the database.
Using the database:  The data included in this database can be used, free of charge, for research and educational purposes. Copying, redistribution, and any unauthorized commercial use is prohibited. The use of this database is restricted to those individuals or organizations that obtained the database directly from this website. Any researcher reporting results which use this database must acknowledge the Wide-field images database. We request you to do so by citing this publication: 

Data description: The photographs for the Wide-field images database were obtained from normal people at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The cohort consisted of 20 normal subjects between 25-45 years of age. The images were acquired using a Daytona 200Tx camera with a 200 degree field of view (FOV). Each subject contains green laser wavelengths image, red laser wavelengths image and pseudocolor (two-color) image with a resolution of 3,900×3,072 pixels. We provide the green wavelength images since they provided a better contrast between blood vessels and background. All images were marked by the ophthalmologists of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.
All of the images contained in the database were actually used for making clinical diagnoses. To ensure the utmost protection of patient privacy, information that might allow the identity of a patient to be reconstructed has been removed, and we have no actual knowledge that the images could be used alone or in combination to identify any subject. To minimize any further risk of breach of privacy, the use of this database is restricted to those individuals or organizations that obtained the database directly from this website.
